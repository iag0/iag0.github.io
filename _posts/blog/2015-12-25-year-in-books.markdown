I read 22 books this year which was a personal best, just 2 shy of 2 books a month. I am going to aim a bit higher next year and read 30 books. Before I start picking out books for next year, let me break down 2015 in books by listing the top 10 books that I read this year.

###10: Flowers for Algernon: Daniel Keyes
An autistic man becomes a subject for an experimental treatment that makes him a high functioning genius. All we read is the journal that the subject writes, yet the book is written in a manner that brings its characters alive. It may be science fiction, but keeps the character treatment sympathetic and humane.
Beautifully written. I absolutely recommend this book to everyone.

###9: The Last lecture: Randy Pausch
Randy Pausch had just months to live, but a lifetime worth of advice to give. Not to the world, but to his kids. And he pens it down in the most simple way. A book worth reading and re-reading.

###8: The Martian: Andy Weir
I got on the Martian bandwagon even before the movie was announced. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which was more like Robinson Crusoe on Mars. I remember reading this book really did feel like sols Mark Watney spends trying to cross the Schiaprelly crater. The movie unfortunately failed to capture the essence of the book; i.e the journey on the barren planet.

###7: A fine balance: Rohinton Mistry
From a previous post, you can figure out that I loved this book. Yet I am struggling to place it at higher up because of the amount of sadness that is filled in this book. The tragedies that a pair of tailors suffer through a politically tumultuous years of emergency are heartbreaking to say the least. I cannot get myself to read this book again.

###6: Slade House: David Mitchell
This is the first horror novella that I have read and though it quite doesn't work like it does in the movies, reading scary novels has a different charm. A set of stories surrounding a haunted house, this book is worth being made into a movie. Absolutely loved it.

###5: Do Androids dream of electric sheep: Philip K. Dick
This movie "Blade Runner" was kind of adapted from this book. Convinced yet? Again we learn how true science fiction is less about technology and more about how it affects human. This book has androids living amongst us, but with blurring lines, PKD explores the age old question of what it is to be human after all.

###4: Sapiens: A brief history of humankind: Yual Noah Harari
Brilliant account of how humankind reached where it stands today. What worked and what did not in the history. Fascinating read. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the book.

###3: Midnight's children: Salman Rushdie
I am nobody to be judging Midnight's children. All I can comment upon is my experience with it. Its a magnum opus, and a book that stands on its own right. It may have made for a lousy movie, but Salman Rushdie is master of his craft. Though there are parts which felt a bit forced and stretched out, this book makes for a wonderful read. It reminded me a lot of "A 100 years of solitude" in terms of narration.
Absolute must read.

###2: Piccadily Jim: P. G. Wodehouse
Utter confusion, mistaken identity often ensues hilarity. This is my first Wodehouse, and I do not remember laughing as hard while reading any other novel. This book is funny as hell.

###1: Cat's  cradle: Kurt Vonnegut
Kurt Vonnegut is a writer in his own right. The book is about a journalist writing a piece on the team responsible for creating the hydrogen bomb and stumbles upon a deadly weapon that could put the world in peril. His quest to solve this mystery takes him to a carribean island with a strange religion. Vonnegut invents a Bokonomism, a new age religion with its own creation myth and the whole shbang. This book is worth reading multiple times. Its a funny and entertaining "thriller".
