### and how all good things should come to an end

A couple of hours after the trailer for the new ghost busters movie was released, the internet collectively decided to pour all its hatred on the movie. The director, actors, the producers were called names, rediculed, hated. What was their crime? -Ruining a childhood memory,  rebooting the franchise, pretending that the original ghost busters never existed. At first I failed to understand what the big deal was. They had just rebooted the movie with girl ghost busters. What I had failed to realize here was that they had not just rebooted the movie, they had pretended that the original ghost busters had never existed! Its a feeling of having your favorite painting vandalized. I would have never experienced this feeling had Harry Potter and the cursed child had never been released.

Harry Potter and the cursed child, panders to the kid in all of us, who grew with Harry, Ron and Hermione. It takes us through some of the most memorable moments from the Harry Potter universe and plays the nostalgia card. I am such a huge fan of Harry Potter that even a very dull account of an ordinary day at Hogwarts is going to drive me nuts and run around in excitement, but this book was a a disappointment for the most part. 

I am all up for setting more stories and seeing more characters in the same universe. It is ok that the magical world is past the gravest of its threats, but I am sure there are younger wizards and witches embarking upon newer adventures, fighting different battles, waiting to entertain an entire new generation and loyal fans once again. But what this book ended up doing for me was getting hung up on the past a bit too much. It is extremely hard to explain my feelings without getting into some of the details.. so

## \*Here be spoilers\*

The story begins with a young Albus Potter befriending Scorpius Malfoy. Scorpius Malfoy being a huge improvement over dull character that Harry was, and Albus is. I really like the fact that Scorpius was given treatment akin to a protagonist. But its a Potter who sets the ball rolling for the most part ( surprise surprise ). If you ask me who the cursed the child turned out to be, I am not sure I will be able to give a definitive answer. Also the "cursed" thing  really does not play into the plot in any way whatsoever. It should have been called Harry Potter and Time Turning plus plus.

A lot of cenes involve the use of a pretty trinket of a  time turner and they end up modifying some of the most defining scenes of the franchise, one of them being Lily and James Potter’s death at the hand of the dark lord. If you take this book into the account, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny were all present at that moment and witnessed the devastating attack on the Potters. As heart breaking and heroic as it is on Harry’s part to decide to not save his parents from the attack so as not change the future, it is an ink stain in what was a perfect memory.

Time travel as a plot device after destroying all the time turners in book 5 seems a bit self serving and lazy. Also, time travel is probably my least favorite aspect in the book. Its a giant gaping plot hole that how come no one could go back in time and stop everything a bit earlier?

The scene involving Cedrick’s first task at the triwizard tournament is yet another example of a memory that is disfigured by our time traveling graffiti artists/vandals. If I have learnt anything about “time turning” in the Harry Potter universe, it is that time turners are present and looking over your shoulder right at this very moment. The reason things go as they go, because time turners choose or not to interfere. But they are always there. And it is this fact that bothers me the most, because all this time travel was happening mostly during the tri wizard tournament, and everything seemed staged. Time travellers botching up and influencing the past has rid Harry Potter of its authenticity in terms of people's actions, choices and their consequences.  

Another problem I had with the book was the lack of depth, lack of gravity about how bad the consequences of a botched up trip across time could be. Professor McGonagall's terse words were akin to a light slap on the wrist for almost fucking up everything everyone did in first seven books. The indifference with which Ginny just brushes past her son’s blunder is beyond my grasp. It almost felt like the writers did not have time to deal with situation, and had a lot of plot points to cover. 

And Delphi and her eventual "arrest" was oddly reminiscent of Scooby Doo episode with finger poitning at the bound villain who can just grunt as his or her identity is revealed.

The only thing that resonates with the series in general is the importance of sacrifice and love and how difficult choices need to be made for the world to be a better place. Snape and Dumbledore remind us of their their legacy much greater than that of Harry. For Harry was born with the prophecy, but the two of them chose to stand up against the evil.

 Now I can only wonder that how safe is the Harry Potter universe and the memories we associate with it? As J.K. Rowling has spoken loud and clear that “happy ever after”  lasts only till some irrsponsible wizard gets hold of time turner or an irresponsible playwright  gets rights to a popular franchise.
