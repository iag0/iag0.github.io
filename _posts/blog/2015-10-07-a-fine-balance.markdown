"A fine balance" by Rohinton Mistry traces the jagged trajectory of two tailors who escape carnage in their village, a widow who employs them, and a paying guest. They all end up sharing the same flat, overcoming the initial barriers and turning into the unlikeliest of families of some sort. Only to have more hardships and misfortunes thrown at each one of them in the wake of politically tumultuous time that state imposed emergency was. The state of emergency emerges as the main antagonist which provides all agents of cruelty and chaos that alters the lives of not just the major characters but everyone in the book.

Amidst travesty and hardships, the characters endlessly yearn for better days, choosing to live in future and the happiness they may stumble upon one day. Balancing between "hope and despair", they all meet disheartening ends of varying degrees.

This is the most depressing book I have read so far. Just when you think things do not get any worse than that, the book throws yet another blow at its characters testing the human endurance to hardships to its limits. It is painful to imagine that people befell such fates during the times of emergency. And there still are people who suffer as much or perhaps more in some parts of the country where injustices cannot be tweeted for the world to read. That there still are small villages where there still are low and high castes and lives of the poor become living hell. That there still are state appointed thugs, corrupt government officers who refuse to respect human life and trample hopes of the poor and struggling, pushing them further into the abyss.


>###“Where humans are concerned, the only emotion that made sense was wonder, at their ability to endure...”

The book left me aghast, with grim scene in the last chapter that shows an upbeat disposition of two of the main characters despite the tragic fate. This is not the triumph of the so called human spirit, but rather how much one can suffer and still barely manage to survive. What happened to all of them? Life defeated them all.

Sadder than the hardships of its characters, circumstances and atrocities committed agains simple, regular people is the book's reach. The book will not be adapted into a popular medium because of the gravity of the subject matter. It will never change the thakurs, babus and lalas that become agent of despair. They keep on going about their usual business, unaware and unperturbed.
