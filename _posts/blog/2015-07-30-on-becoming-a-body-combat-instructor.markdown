##### or how I became a BodyCombat instructor and loved it.

### Hates Gym
I hate most physical activities. Team sports are my pet objects for hatred.
I think they bring out the worst in mankind, but that is a discussion for another
day. What I am getting at is that I, have never been this gym going, sports
playing, agile and strong person. I still am none of those things, except for
the gym going part.

No gym with any number of treadmills could keep me around. To be honest, I think
gyms are boring. And the who's who they attract: self serving, mirror hugging, tights
wearing, selfie taking, make for a terrible company even when they are not talking to you.
But then I entered my gym, which, make no mistakes had all those people still, but had
group classes. And of all things, BodyCombat. Spoiler alert, I am going to like it very
much.

If you are reminded of a music videos from the 90s which had spandex clad models
and creepy lurker looming around, oh boy are you the wrongest you have ever been
in your life. A group class keeps you and your survival instincts on their toes.
You get so busy just keeping alive that you barely find to be looking anywhere.

### Loves group classes
Loud music, club lights, shortness of breath and a hysterical urge to kill
every repetition is no less than other highs. And I kept coming for more, like
a drug. Before I knew, I was listening to their music, dreaming about the class
itself, like I was in the grip of BodyCombat. The BodyCombat playlist would run
shiver down my spines, and my heart rate would rise in anticipation of the workout.
The only fix was a bit of boxing, some capoeira with a healthy dose of beastly
Muay Thai. Like every addict, I hated when I could not get my fix when the class
got cancelled. The big wide wild old mean world that we live in, there is never
anyone else worthy of being relied upon but yourself. That very thought did me
in and I became a huge motivation when the circus came to town and I happily
signed up for it.

### Crazy idea!
If you have seen me, I am the most unlikely candidate for becoming a gym
instructor. I am just the average of the average of the Bangalore working class.
I was the book going to be judged mostly by its cover. And if being questioned by
the fitness fraternity was not enough, some friends were disheartened at my
pursuit of lesser things. Now, I did not want to be an instructor, I just thought
it would be really challenging to survive the bootcamp. And the rare cosmic alignment
of planets that did pass the assessment, there would be another video submission
that would prevent me from becoming an instructor. There are not many things in my
life that I have chosen for myself. Being an engineer was my destiny ( so says my dad.
Pros and Cons in some other post). Education is not a choice either (
a privilege rather  ). But if I think honestly, this was one thing no one
wanted me to, no one needed me to do. Something that I could might as well just
skip and forget about it. And turns out that just made me want to do it even more.

### BodyCombat bootcamp
Surviving the bootcamp was going to be hard. The expectation is to cross over from
the following aspect of the class to the leading aspect. Execution of movements
needed to be correct, to be delivered with right cues with the music. As if learning
the moves was not enough that we were expected to master the cuing aspect of the
class as well. But I was lucky enough to pass the module. The happiness of it all
and the swag in my walk would last one whole week, after which I got a taste
of actually presenting just 2 tracks. Thats 15 minutes of stage time and about 20%
of workout.

### Shit gets real
Loud music, club lights, shortness of breath and a little nausea. That summarizes
my first time on stage presenting 2 tracks. It is hard. To have 30 people looking
up to you, to follow not just movement but mistakes you make. I could no longer
surrender to the music. There is no autopilot when you are on stage. Every iota
of time you get is spent in timing the next kick, delivering the next cue.

Its all play and fun until you start taking classes on a regular basis, sometimes
two of them within 12 hours of each other. Its only then you start appreciating
how easily us software engineers get paid, cozying up to our coffee mugs while
sitting on our desks without much physical effort. A desk job is boon in bane.
I was next to certain that I was not going to pursue this hobby any further.
I was an instructor for a provisional period and was required to submit a video
of my class for an actual certification. I though this is where I would stop. But..

### Shit gets real-er
What harm would a video submission have do? They will tell me that I am horrible
trainer and reject me. They will take their pitch forks and set me on fire perhaps?
Fine. They fail me, and I can finally comfort myself with the truth that I tried,
and I failed, and I could move on. I planned on recording my classes, and as the
fate would have it, every planned recording came out worse than the previous one.
And it was at this point, when I just wanted to get done with it, and I posted
a practice video, which was taken without any intentions of submission. It would
be pretty horrible if I would fail the submission after having written so much
about it. Well, I passed, to my surprise and of many others.

### Happily ever after

I am proud software engineer who moonlights at a gym as body combat instructor.
What is the best part of it? As anyone in the service industry will swear by these
two words, customer satisfaction. A roomful of weary, tired yet proud Body Combat
warriors who keep coming week after week, thats the best part. I am treating
it as a hobby, feeding my passion by training to become better at it, seeking
help from some of the pros, not because anyone expects me to, but because I want to.

I am taking classes almost every week. I substitute classes when the regular
trainers cannot make it, like if there was batman of Body Combat, taking matters
into their own hands.. No I didn't say it. But feel free :D.
Being a trainer is hard. It comes with its own challenges just like any other
profession. I have a new found respect for people who have made a living out it.
I made some new friends, lots of acquaintances. Being recognized in a cafe nearby
does feel like being a celebrity still :P, but I will get used to it.
But seriously, no autographs please.
