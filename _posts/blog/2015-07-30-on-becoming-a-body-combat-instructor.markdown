##### or how I became a BodyCombat instructor and loved it.

### Hates Gym
I hate most forms of physical activities. Team sports are my pet objects for hatred.
I think they bring out the worst in mankind, but that is a discussion for another
day. What I am getting at is that I have never been this gym going, sports
playing, agile and strong person. I still am none of those things, except for
the gym going part.

No gym with any number of treadmills could keep me around. To be honest, I think
gyms are boring. And the who's who they attract: self serving, mirror hugging, tights
wearing, selfie taking, make for a terrible company even when they are not talking to you.
But then I entered my gym, which, had all those people still, but also had group classes. 
And of all things, BodyCombat. Spoiler alert, I am going to like it very
much.


### Loves group classes
If you are reminded of a music videos from the 90s which had spandex clad models
and creepy lurker looming around, oh boy are you the wrongest you have ever been
in your life. A group class keeps you and your survival instincts on their toes.
You get so busy just keeping alive that you barely find to be looking anywhere.

Loud music, club lights, shortness of breath and a hysterical urge to kill
every repetition is no less than other highs. And I kept coming for more, like
a drug. Before I knew, I was listening to their music, dreaming about the class
itself, like I was in the grip of BodyCombat. The BodyCombat playlist would run
shivers down my spines, and my heart rate would rise in anticipation of the workout.
The only fix was a bit of boxing, some capoeira with a healthy dose of beastly
Muay Thai. Like every addict, I hated it when I could not get my dose when the class
got cancelled. 

The big wide wild old mean world that we live in, there is never
anyone else worthy of being relied upon but yourself. That very thought did me
in and it became a huge motivation. When the circus came to town, I happily
signed up for it.

### Crazy idea!
If you have seen me, I am the most unlikely candidate for becoming a gym
instructor. I am just the average of the average of the Bangalore working class.
I was the book that was going to be judged mostly by its cover. And if being questioned by
the fitness fraternity was not enough, some friends were disheartened at my
pursuit of lesser things. Now, I did not want to be an instructor, I just thought
it would be really challenging to survive the bootcamp. And the rare cosmic alignment
of planets that I did pass the assessment, there would be another video submission
that would totally prevent me from becoming an instructor. There are not many things in my
life that I have chosen for myself. Being an engineer was my destiny ( so says my dad.
Pros and Cons in some other post). Education is not a choice either (
a privilege rather  ). But if I think honestly, this was one thing no one
wanted me to, no one needed me to do. Something that I could might as well just
skip and forget about it. And turns out that just made me want to do it even more.

### BodyCombat bootcamp
Surviving the bootcamp was going to be hard. The expectation is to cross over from
the following aspect of the class to the leading aspect. Execution of movements
needed to be correct, to be delivered with right cues with the music.But I was lucky 
enough to pass the module. The happiness of it all and the swag in my walk would 
last one whole week, after which I got a taste of actually presenting just 2 tracks. 
That is 15 minutes of stage time and about 20% of the workout.

### Shit gets real
Loud music, club lights, shortness of breath and a little bit of nausea. That summarizes
my first time on stage presenting 2 tracks. It is hard. To have 30 people looking
up to you, to follow not just movement but mistakes you make. I could no longer
surrender to the music. There is no autopilot when you are on stage. Every iota
of time you get is spent in timing the next kick, delivering the next cue.

Its all play and fun until you start taking classes on a regular basis, sometimes
two of them within 12 hours of each other. Its only then you start appreciating
how easily us software engineers get paid, cozying up to our coffee mugs while
sitting on our desks without much physical effort. I was next to certain that I
was not going to pursue this hobby any further. I was an instructor for a provisional
period and was required to submit a video of my class for an actual certification.
I though this is where I would stop. But..

### Shit gets real-er
What harm would a video submission do? They will tell me that I am horrible
trainer and reject me. They will take their pitch forks and set me on fire?
Fine. I will fail, and I will finally comfort myself with the truth that I tried,
and I did not succeed. I would finally be able to move on. 

I planned on recording my classes, and as the fate would have it, every planned 
recording came out worse than the previous one. Its like Universe was delivering
me a backhanded slap. And I gave up. I posted a practice video, which was taken 
without any intentions of submission. 
Do you think I would have written a such a long post about this all if I had failed?
That will only be an exercise in thought, because I actually passed the assessment.
It came as a shock to me, surprise to many.

### Happily ever after

I am a proud software engineer who moonlights at a gym as body combat instructor.
What is the best part of it? As anyone in the service industry will tell you: 
customer satisfaction. A roomful of weary, tired, on the verge of collapse yet proud
Body Combat warriors who keep coming week after week, thats the best part. I am treating
it as a hobby, feeding my passion by training to become better at it, seeking
help from some of the pros, not because anyone expects me to, but because I want to.

I am taking classes almost every week. I substitute classes when the regular
trainers cannot make it, like if there was batman of Body Combat, taking matters
into their own hands. :D
Being a trainer is hard. It comes with its own challenges just like any other
profession. I have a new found respect for people who have made a living out it.
I made some new friends, lots of acquaintances. Some people like me, some not so much.
But I am happy. It is a huge extra curricular milestone, my Ironman. And it has its 
benefits. You run into people who have attended your classes and get recognized in 
cafes nearby all the time, its not like I am a celebrity, but its a nice feeling.
Certainly a new feeling. And I will probably get used to feeling like a rockstar,
but seriously, no autographs please :P
