## Better days

I sleep the day, keep up at night,  
spending the wake in restless ways,  
"what if", "had been", that haunt my dreams,  
I just wait for better days.  

The good old days are gone too.  
And what good they were  
if they brought me where I stand.  

The naysayers blame for standing still,  
for not changing when the winds had changed,  
but I had resigned to serve my fate.  
perhaps just sit and wait.  

When has patience borne its fruit,  
a poisonous tree that kicks and bites,  
with lies of the world,  
in eyes of the world,  
my spirit and strength had died.  

Given up all but my hope,  
having been given up on too.  
Rid from all expectations,  
free from responsibility.  
Are these them?  
The better days  
that I was waiting for?  
Perhaps I will find out some day.  
till then,  
I just wait for better days.
