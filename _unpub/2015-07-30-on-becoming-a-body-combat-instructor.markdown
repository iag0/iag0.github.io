## How I became a BodyCombat trainer and loved it.

I hate most physical activities. Team sports are my pet objects for hatred. I think
they bring out the worst in mankind, but that is a discussion for another day. What 
I am getting at is that I, have never been this gym going, sports playing, agile and
strong person. I still am none of those things, except for the gym going part.

No gym with any number of treadmills could keep me around. To be honest, I think gyms
are boring. And the who's who they attract: self serving, mirror hugging, tights
wearing, selfie taking, make for a terrible company even when they are not talking to you.
But then I entered my gym, which, make no mistakes had all those people still, but had
group classes. And of all things, BodyCombat.

If you are reminded of 90's music videos with pelvic thrusting suggestive
workout amidst spandex clad modelesque people, I have some kind words for you.
If you don't already know, in a group class your survival instincts are
working hard at keeping you alive, you are far too busy to be looking anywhere. If you
are not, you would politely asked to leave.
I was instantly drawn to the sheer sense of accomplishment that I derived out of having survived a one
hour ordeal. Loud music, club lights, shortness of breath and a hysterical urge to kill
every repetition is no less than other highs. And I kept going for more, like a drug.
Before I knew, I was listening to their music, dreaming about the class itself, like I was in
a grip of BodyCombat and it just refused to let go.

I started to look forward to Monday evenings for weekly combat fix. A bit of boxing,
a bit of muay thai and I would last a week. And I hated it when the class got cancelled.
Well, in this big old mean world, you have nothing to rely upon but yourself. Next thing I 
knew was that I signed up for becoming a BodyCombat trainer.

If you have seen me, I am the most unlikely candidate for becoming a gym instructor. I am 
just the average of the average of the Bangalore working class. I was the book going to be
judged mostly by its cover. And if being questioned by the fitness fraternity was not enough,
some friends were disheartened at my pursuit of lesser things. Now, I did not want to be an 
instructor. I just wanted to survive the two day bootcamp at first. And in the unlikely
event of actually passing the assessment would I give a thought to whether I want to really do it.
This is one of those rare things that I committed to, out of free will. Education doesn't count,
and everyone has to have a job. So whatever little I did out of choice, I wanted to badly commit
to it.

Survivng the bootcamp was going to be hard. One does not only need to execute the movements,
but coach them while performing with cues. This was in addition to the physical stress I 
was going to put myself under. Surviving drills, technique sessions, hours of back to back
body combat sessions till you get a hang of it. It was pretty challanging, a little of
mental exhaustion as well when you just feel like going home and catching some sleep. But I was
lucky enough to pass the module. I could feel a sense of accomplishment, sheer joy of being
an absolute noob and still beating a whole bunch of people who were very much a part of the
industry. I got a real swag in my walk for a few days, that was until I presented 2 tracks 
in my first class ever.

Loud music, club lights, shortness of breath and a little nausea. That summarises my first
time on stage presenting 2 tracks. It is hard. To have 30 people looking up to you, to follow
not just movement but mistakes you make. The sheer sense of responsibility I had during those
two tracks was a whole another world as compared to a sense of surrender I used to experience
as a member. I could no longer surrender to the music. There is no autopilot when you are
on stage. Every iota of time you get is spent in timing the next kick, delivering the next cue.

Its all play and fun until you start taking classes on a regular basis, sometimes multiple of them 
within 12 hours of each other. Its only then you start appreciating how easily we get paid
sitting on our desks without much physical effort. A desk job is boon in bane. I was next to certain
that I was not going to pursue this hobby any further. I was an instructor for a provisional period
and was required to submit a video of my class for an actual certification. I though this
is where I would stop. But..

What harm would a video submission have done? 
It would have told me that I am a horrible instructor and would have rejected me at most, I already
risked suspension unless I submitted a video. I would let the LesMills body tell me that I am horrible,
and then I would stop.
Every class I recorded with an intent to submit a decent submission tape, it bombed. The only thing
worth using was a trial run I did, with absolute no intention of submitting it.
Being told a flat out No, is sometimes easier than being told to try harder. And this is what I feared.
Because if I was told to try harder, I would have tried harder and every failure would have hurt much
more than the previous one. But as luck would have it again, to my surprise and surprise of many others,
I passed the video assessment. Utter disbelief ensued, resulting in stupid facebook updates too.
Even though a do not wish to pursue this in the longer run, and I am happily keeping my software job,
I cannot help but feed this passion a bit more, work on being a better instructor.

I am taking classes almost every week. I substitute classes when the regular trainers cannot make it, 
Like if there was batman of bodycombat, taking matters into their own hands.. No I didn't say it. But feel 
free :D.
Being a trainer is hard. It comes with its own challenges just like any other profession. I have
a new found respect for people who have made a living out it. I made some new friends, lots of
acquaintances. Being recognized in a cafe nearby does feel like being a celebrity still :P, but
I will get used to it. But seriously, no autographs please.
