## Prateek Nigam
I am a software engineer working for Arista Networks in Bangalore, India currently working in the Software defined networking team. 
I am reading when I am not working. I also enjoy watching movies, learning random trivia and reading random things keeps me sane ( or does it? ). Not much of a writer, but day dream about being really kick ass at blogginh. I recently got certified as a LesMilss BodyCombat instructor.
